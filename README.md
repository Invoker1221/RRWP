# Reinforced Retaining Wall Pro
## Introduction:
Reinforced Retaining Wall Pro is a Geotechnical Enineering Software for complete design and analysis of Reinforce Retaining Walls. This software provides ergonomic environment for full fledge design of Reinforced Retaining Walls.  
This software is developed in JAVA language using “IntelliJ IDEA” IDE. This software has a decent interface designed using “JAVA FX” GUI library. A visual layout tool called “Scene Builder” is also used to create the interface of this software.
This software is developed by a Civil Engineering student of NUST Institute of Civil Engineering as final year project. Any kind of constructive feedback or help is appreciated.Feel free to contact me on this email: eng.haiderali@hotmail.com
 ## Awards:
*This software was awarded _Geotechnical Project of Year_ by Pakistan Geotechnical Engineering Society in 2016 _ICNCGE Conference_.
![Geotechnical Project of Year Award](https://ibb.co/gSDqJb)
*This software was nominated for top 5 groups for _Rectors Gold Medal_ by NUST Institute of Civil Engineering.

## Features:
*It simulates 3 wall types :
  *Cantilever Wall
  *Counterfort Wall
  *L-Shape Wall
*It simulates 4 loading conditions:
  *Horizontal Surcharge
  *Sloping Surcharge
  *Super Imposed Loading
  *Track Loading
*It operates in both SI & FPS units.
*It provides seismic design using Mononobe-Okabe Method.
*It has built in Literature Hints available for each input field.
*Advanced Inputs option for modification of design which provides  complete flexibility.
*Calculates 5 FOS checks :
  *Overturning check
  *Sliding check
  *Eccentricity check
  *Bearing capacity check
  *Shear check
*Provides main steel curtailment table for stem & counterfort to ensure economical use of steel.
*Image View button which provides complete details of all the dimensions  and  reinforcements through cross sectional view. This image is detailed enough to be used directly for execution of work.
*It imports an excel file which contains complete details of all the calculations carried out stepwise to design the wall.
*It calculates Development Length (Ld) using ACI code section 12.2.2
*_Lateral Earth Pressure Calculator_ is a side tool software of RRWP. It calculates active, passive and rest earth pressure using *Rankine* & *Coulomb* theory. It can simulate any number of strata of soil and saturation condition. It also operates in both SI & FPS unit system. This software is embedded in RRWP.
